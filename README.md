# Hex
ZX Spectrum [Hex Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game))

Inspired on Greg Surma [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/hex-creating-intelligent-opponents-with-minimax-driven-ai-part-1-%CE%B1-%CE%B2-pruning-cc1df850e5bd) this is my (real) first ZX Spectrum assembly project.

I use [SpectNet IDE](https://dotneteer.github.io/spectnetide/) for developing, but you can use another IDE importing the sourde code with only a few changes.
